## Todo

* Need way to fix registers again (e.g. in sorter control, downReq is getting overwritten when it
needs to persist)
* Make this a MIPS super-set, with arbitrary variables that can be fixed via alias?
* Do something with NOR in simplifying an expression like !(a or b)
* Remove lv-rv validating from parsing (from Stmt::try_from_pair)
