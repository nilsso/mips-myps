## Todo

* Do something with NOR in simplifying an expression like !(a or b)
* Might be able to scope fixed vars by block; would need fixed to not just be a boolean
    but an option of a struct with the line numbers for the scope (which would need to be
    adjusted by the mips optimizer when lines are removed)
