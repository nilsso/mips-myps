# Precision single-gas driven furnace controller
# (nilsso)
#
# NOTE: To start operation, write a "value" greater than zero to the housing. This value is taken to
# be a code for the target temperature and pressure with the format `PPPTTT`, where tT=TTT*10$ and
# pT=PPP*100. To end operation/put on idle, write -1 to the housing.
#
# e.g. 500050 -> tT = 050*10 = 500 K, pT = 500*100 = 50,000 kPa = 50 MPa
#
# IMPORTANT: Validation for this input is not done here, and the program will attempt to use
# whatever it is given. If the target temperature is less-than the cold source temperature or
# greater than the hot source temperature then wackiness will certainly occurr!
# (I may change this point in the future)
